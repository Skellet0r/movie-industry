# Jupyter Notebooks

When we use notebooks in our work, we often subdivide the notebooks folder. For example, `notebooks/exploratory` contains initial explorations, whereas `notebooks/reports` is more polished work that can be exported as html to the reports directory.

Follow a naming convention that shows the owner and the order the analysis was done in. We use the format `<step>-<ghuser>-<description>.ipynb` (e.g., `0.3-bull-visualize-distributions.ipynb`).
